## Implementation Guide

### Email Service Setup

**Recommended Tools:**
- **SendGrid** (transactional + marketing)
- **Mailchimp** (marketing campaigns)
- **ConvertKit** (creator-focused)
- **Resend** (developer-friendly)

### Integration with Next.js

```typescript
// lib/email.ts
import { Resend } from 'resend';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function sendWelcomeEmail(email: string, name: string) {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'ClipTune <hello@cliptune.com>',
    to: email,
    subject: 'Welcome to ClipTune! 🎬',
    html: welcomeEmailTemplate(name),
  });
}
```

### Trigger Setup

**PostHog Events:**
```javascript
// Track email opens and clicks
posthog.capture('email_opened', {
  email_type: 'welcome',
  user_id: userId,
});

posthog.capture('email_clicked', {
  email_type: 'welcome',
  link: 'upgrade',
  user_id: userId,
});
```

**Supabase Functions:**
```sql
-- Create function to send welcome email
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION send_welcome_email()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Trigger email service
  PERFORM net.http_post(
    url := 'https://api.resend.com/emails',
    headers := '{"Authorization": "Bearer ' || current_setting('app.resend_key') || '"}',
    body := json_build_object(
      'to', NEW.email,
      'subject', 'Welcome to ClipTune!',
      'html', welcome_email_template(NEW.name)
    )
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Trigger on user creation
CREATE TRIGGER on_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION send_welcome_email();
```
